## Current Research Projects

### **Multidimensional Pain Assessment in Marine Mammals**

Developing machine learning classifiers to identify and quantify pain through behavioral indicators in seals and sea lions, including validation through structured behavioral scales.

### **Cortisol/DHEA-S Ratio as a Biomarker for Well-being in California Sea Lions**

Evaluating the cortisol and DHEA-S hormonal profiles as biomarkers of animal welfare in California sea lions (*Zalophus californianus*) to assess their adaptive responses to environmental stressors, especially acoustic stimuli.

### **Human-IBL Task**

Adapting the International Brain Laboratory rodent behavioral task for human participants. This project involves collecting pilot datasets with integrated eye-tracking and EEG recordings to enable direct comparison of neural activity patterns between humans and rodents.

### **Theories of Human Consciousness (COGITATE Consortium)**

Utilizing large-scale MEEG, ECoG, and fMRI datasets to systematically evaluate competing theories of human consciousness and explore cognitive processes using advanced exploratory analysis and modeling techniques.

### **Behavioral Tasks for Human Decision-Making**

Designing and implementing novel decision-making tasks informed by game theory and reinforcement learning, aiming to unravel the cognitive strategies employed by individuals and their corresponding neural correlates.

### **Facial Analysis Tool Development**

Creating accessible, user-friendly software for sentiment and emotion analysis through advanced machine learning pipelines applied to video data, enabling non-technical researchers to leverage sophisticated analytic methods.
