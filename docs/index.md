The **Computational, Cognitive, and Behavioral Neuroscience Lab (CCBN)** investigates the neural basis of behavior, cognition, and decision-making through innovative experimental techniques, computational modeling, and theory. Led by Assistant Professor Niccolò Bonacchi, our interdisciplinary work bridges animal and human neuroscience, emphasizing large-scale neural dynamics, temporal processing, brain states, and decision-making.

## Our Mission

We aim to understand how the brain processes information, adapts to new contexts, and generates behavior. By combining behavioral experiments, computational modeling, electrophysiology, and machine learning, we strive to offer mechanistic explanations for cognitive processes and develop open tools and data frameworks for neuroscience research. A significant aspect of our mission includes advocating for open science, reproducibility, and data-sharing practices within the neuroscience community.

## Research Focus

Our main research interests include:

- Neural circuits underlying perception, decision-making, and learning
- Development of novel tools for neuroscience research
- Machine learning applications for neural and behavioral data
- Multispecies comparative neuroscience (animal and human studies)
- Open-science practices, neuroinformatics, and reproducible research
