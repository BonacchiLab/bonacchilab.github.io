The **Computational, Cognitive, and Behavioral Neuroscience Lab (CCBN)** investigates the neural basis of behavior, cognition, and decision-making through innovative experimental techniques, computational modeling, and theory. Led by Assistant Professor Niccolò Bonacchi, our interdisciplinary work bridges animal and human neuroscience, emphasizing large-scale neural dynamics, temporal processing, brain states, and decision-making.

## Our Mission

We aim to understand how the brain processes information, adapts to new contexts, and generates behavior. By combining behavioral experiments, computational modeling, electrophysiology, and machine learning, we strive to offer mechanistic explanations for cognitive processes and develop open tools and data frameworks for neuroscience research. A significant aspect of our mission includes advocating for open science, reproducibility, and data-sharing practices within the neuroscience community.

## Research Focus

Our main research interests include:

- Neural circuits underlying perception, decision-making, and learning
- Development of novel tools for neuroscience research
- Machine learning applications for neural and behavioral data
- Multispecies comparative neuroscience (animal and human studies)
- Open-science practices, neuroinformatics, and reproducible research

## Current Projects

Detailed descriptions of our ongoing research include:

- **Multidimensional Pain Assessment in Marine Mammals**: Developing machine learning classifiers to identify and quantify pain through behavioral indicators in seals and sea lions, including validation through structured behavioral scales.
- **Cortisol/DHEA-S Ratio as a Biomarker for Well-being in California Sea Lions**: Evaluating the cortisol and DHEA-S hormonal profiles as biomarkers of animal welfare in California sea lions (*Zalophus californianus*) to assess their adaptive responses to environmental stressors, especially acoustic stimuli.
- **Human-IBL Task**: Adapting the International Brain Laboratory rodent behavioral task for human participants. This project involves collecting pilot datasets with integrated eye-tracking and EEG recordings to enable direct comparison of neural activity patterns between humans and rodents.
- **Theories of Human Consciousness (COGITATE Consortium)**: Utilizing large-scale MEEG, ECoG, and fMRI datasets to systematically evaluate competing theories of human consciousness and explore cognitive processes using advanced exploratory analysis and modeling techniques.
- **Behavioral Tasks for Human Decision-Making**: Designing and implementing novel decision-making tasks informed by game theory and reinforcement learning, aiming to unravel the cognitive strategies employed by individuals and their corresponding neural correlates.
- **Facial Analysis Tool Development**: Creating accessible, user-friendly software for sentiment and emotion analysis through advanced machine learning pipelines applied to video data, enabling non-technical researchers to leverage sophisticated analytic methods.
